## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** and sanitize outputs
4. **Follow OWASP guidelines** for secure coding
5. **Keep dependencies updated** and scan for vulnerabilities
6. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
7. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information

### For Administrators
1. **Enable MFA** for all accounts
2. **Use strong passwords** and rotate regularly
3. **Limit access** based on principle of least privilege
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep systems updated** with latest security patches
6. **Backup data regularly** and test restore procedures
7. **Implement network segmentation** and firewall rules

### For Users
1. **Use strong, unique passwords** for your account
2. **Enable MFA** when available
3. **Keep browsers updated** and use secure connections
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately
5. **Don't share credentials** or access tokens
6. **Log out** when finished using the application
